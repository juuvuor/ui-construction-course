User prompt 1:
Change files that way that when you have buyed the ticket you can't buy another. Until the one is used. 

Copilot answer 1:
You can now only buy a ticket if you haven't already bought one. After buying, the "Buy a ticket" button is disabled until you redeem your ticket, at which point you can buy again. The buttons are enabled/disabled accordingly on page load and after each action.

Let me know if you want to adjust the logic or button behavior!

User prompt 2:
hide the other button when it is not possible to use

Copilot answer 2:
Now, only the button that is usable ("Buy a ticket" or "Redeem your ticket") will be visible at any time. The other button will be hidden until it becomes available to use.

Let me know if you want further adjustments!

Copilot answer 3:
A small round info button (ℹ️) has been added. When clicked, it opens a notification window saying "You can only buy one ticket at a time." The info notification is styled to match your UI.

Let me know if you want to adjust the text, icon, or placement!

The background effect has been removed. Your page now uses a simple solid background color. Let me know if you want to adjust the color or make any other changes!

User prompt 7:
it looks bad in phone 

Copilot answer 7:
The site is now more mobile-friendly: the container and buttons are nearly full width, padding and font sizes are reduced, and notifications are easier to read on small screens. Reload on your phone to see the improved layout! Let me know if you want further tweaks for mobile.

User prompt 8:
Make info and error box that way that you can't do anything during the time it is shown. so you can't push other button same time when info tex is wisible

Copilot answer 8:
Now, when an info or error notification is shown, both buttons are disabled and cannot be clicked until the notification disappears. This ensures the user can't interact with the buttons while a message is visible. Let me know if you want to adjust the timing or add a visual indicator for the disabled state!

User prompt 9:
when  phone is wertical and there is no room for showing info txt and buttons, put buttons to horisontal order.

Copilot answer 9:
On small vertical phone screens with limited height, the buttons will now appear side by side (horizontally) instead of stacked. This ensures both the info text and buttons are visible and usable.

Let me know if you want to further adjust the responsive layout!
